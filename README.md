# p5 React Renderer
This library allows you to use p5.js as a render target for React. This means you can write interactive p5 code while leveraging the power of React's declarative style.

Writing p5 sketches this way opens up the door for reusable components and cleaner code, even when the sketches grow in complexity.

## Why?
I am a big fan of the p5.js library and html canvas more generally. However, complexity quickly get's out of hand with p5, especially as the library itself encourages globals and code is necessarily imperative. 

By using React you get all the advantages of declarative code with clean, reusable and reactive components. All the while still maintaining the easy to use abstractions exposed by p5.

## Word of warning
This is super super alpha right now, so use at your own discretion.
